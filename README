README:

distrofy-plugin is a GPLv3 software plugin for the Gimp. It comes with related scripts covered by the GPLv3 whether marked by the license or not. Don't believe me? Yer itchin' fer a fight.

Status:

The distrofy.py script itself is still functional as of Gimp 2.4.
It has also been alleged to work on 2.6.

batchDistrofy was intended to allow for command-line processing of
 images in the style of distrofy. 
batchDistrofy development has halted due to some lacking documentation on
how to interface python-fu with the gimp's backend from the command line. 
the automation of gimp is intended to be done in scheme, and I don't feel like rewriting it at the moment.

included is a getHotBabe.py script to grab you a random girl off a website
that... well it has pictures of hot girls.
