Status:

The distrofy.py script itself is still functional as of Gimp 2.4,
but is untested with Gimp 2.6

batchDistrofy was intended to allow for command-line processing of
 images in the style of distrofy. 
batchDistrofy development has halted due to some lacking documentation on
how to interface python-fu with the gimp's backend from the command line. 
(my understanding of the docs states that the native list-like script-fu 
should be used to load the python-fu from the command line, and it doesn't 
seem to work as shown on gimp.org)

included is a getHotBabe.py script to grab you a random girl off a website
that... well it has pictures of hot girls.
